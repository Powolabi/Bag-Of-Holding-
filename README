Bag of Holding

//////////////

Created by Brendan, Micah and Peter, For our final project we are building "Bag of Holding"
a tool for creating, saving and editing your character sheets.

For version 0.1.0, we were a bit behind and had the classes and nodes defined. as well as the ability to roll dice

For version 0.2.0 we started a GUI, and got the application to save user input to a txt file

for version 0.3.0 we gave up on the GUI, created a console window menu, and added the ability to access saved characters

Manual:

HOW TO RUN THE PROGRAM:
We had issues running from gradle.
The program gives errors if you try to run from gradle tasks.
To run our software you need to run the menu class.

CREATE NEW CHARACTER:
Type "new" in the opening menu.
When you've finished, simply type "quit".
The software will close and your character will be saved!

ACCESS SAVED CHARACTERS:
Once you have already saved at least one character
Type "saved" in the opening menu
A list of your saved characters will pop up
From there type the number of the one you want

COMMANDS:
After you choose a saved character
The screen will ask
"What would you like to do next"
Now you can do a few other things

- "menu" will open the first menu
- "stats" will display the character's stats
- "roll" will give you die options for automatic rolls
- "quit" will close the program
