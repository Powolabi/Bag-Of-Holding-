Bag of Holding

//////////////

Created by Brendan, Micah and Peter, For our final project we are building "Bag of Holding"
a tool for creating, saving and editing your character sheets.

For version 0.1.0, we were a bit behind and had the classes and nodes defined. as well as the ability to roll dice

For version 0.2.0 we started a GUI, and got the application to save user input to a txt file

for version 0.3.0 we gave up on the GUI, created a console window menu, and added the ability to access saved characters

Manual:

Firstly, we had issues with Gradle, and the program gives errors if you try to run from gradle tasks.
To run our software you simply right click on the main class, and run that instead.

The best way to use this software is to save a character or multiple. To do that you type new in the
opening menu. When you've finished, simply type quit. The software will close and your character will be saved!
You can access the saved characters by running it again, then typing saved in the opening menu.
From there you can type a few different words to do things like see your character's stats,
roll a die, or leave the application. Sadly, to edit your character's info you'll have to
create a new one using the same name to overwrite the old file.
